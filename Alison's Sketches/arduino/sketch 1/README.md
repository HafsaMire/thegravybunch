# Illuminating Led lights with a photoresistor

With the help of this sketch, a green, a red and a yellow led will light up depending on the amount of light that is registered by a photoresistor.

# Assembly

You will need:
- an arduino uno
- the arduino IDE or web editor
- one red led
- one yellow led
- one green led
- one photoresistor
- 4 x 220 Ohm resistors
- jumper wires


When connected and running, the values in the if-statements will need to be adjusted to the lighting situation you are in.
It depends largely on whether there is daylight or artificial lighting which values you need for it to work as it should.

In order to be able to see the values, open the serial monitor in arduino and choose a value for each led.
