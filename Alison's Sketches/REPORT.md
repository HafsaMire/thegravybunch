Technical Notes

The experience of making use of programming in the prototyping process was quite ambivalent at times.

Finding my way in the programming sphere was quite tough in the beginning of this course, seeing as I only had very limited knowledge of programming.

Throughout the course of this project however, we made use of Arduino a lot, which I was already familiar with.

They way we used the electronic components aided us in quickly being able to test the effect that certain interactive behaviours would have on the users. Once the code was in place and working, I was able to change the behaviour of my prototypes rapidly - changing colours, delay times, the distances at which the prototype reacted to users etc. My cardboard prototypes reached a state of higher fidelity rapidly by simply adding the arduino components to it and without necessarily needing to change its material or form.

This however was counterproductive in some ways aswell. The feeling of high fidelity emitted by the prototypes in early stages misled me to focussing more on the perfection of the code instead of working extensively with exploring materials, shapes and form.  

For me, programming is still quite time-consuming due to it being a new language for me. The correct syntax needs to be in place, similar to vocabulary, for me to be able to use this new language efficiently. This meant that the process of programming the arduino and making the different components work together took up a lot of my prototyping time and our time together as a group.

The main focus suddenly shifted from reiterating concepts to making the code work because programming, if applied efficiently, is a major resource in prototyping interactive experiences. It will add high fidelity to low fidelity prototypes, it is frequently changeable and adaptable but programming had a tendency of limiting me in my ability to maintain an open mind and look at the context and our possibilities with fresh eyes now and then.

However, after having worked on coding extensively in this project, especially after having worked on the serial communication between the arduino and a websocket, I feel that I have reached a higher level of comprehension for how programming works and how it carries almost endless possibilities of connectivity in prototyping.

And while the sheer amount of possibilities in being able to combine and connect various coding languages is quite overwhelming, I find that prototyping with code is very rewarding.
