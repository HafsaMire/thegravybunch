# Alison's readme

In the arduino folder, the first three sketches consist of pure arduino code whereas sketch 4 is using serial communication through a websocket.

The individual readme files in each sketch will go through the individual procedures of setting up the sketches and for easier assembly, each folder has its own fritzing scheme.
