# Technical Notes
#### Karl Söderby
In the start of Programming II, programming was an alien term to me. Due to lacking previous experience and how everything connected, I felt this course was going to be a very tough battle. It turned out it was, but before this project I felt much more comfortable with it. The struggle with understanding syntaxes, what a function does and how everything works together turned into a tool. A tool that could enhance a piece of cardboard into a hi-fi prototype or a tool that could turn transform a hand gesture into something visible on the screen. 

So where does programming fit in the Physical Prototyping spectre? Where is it helping and where is it doing the opposite? Firstly, and I believe it is a fundamental reason why it is used: it gives life to the prototype that raw material can’t explain by itself. By making something interactive and giving feedback which isn’t static, the user can visualise the concept much better. That is of great value, as the users input is the most valuable, and the better they can understand it, the better you will progress. Secondly, it also provides the designer with valuable input on what type of interaction one wants to use and discover new ways of doing so.

A great example of where code was essential to displaying the functions of the prototype, was when I established a connection between the Arduino and the browser. By hooking up two photo-resistors on the Arduino, I was able to use them as triggers for functions on the webpage. It made a cross-device connection possible where I could try out different ways of making a webpage react to the photo-resistors values. This itself made the prototype come alive in a sense that it was communicating with the computer, which had great demonstrational value.

But although programming has helped in bringing prototypes to life, it doesn’t come without obstacles. It can be time-consuming, mind-wrecking and sometimes obsolete, as programming might not be required to express certain things, and then many hours can be lost in the process. It is essential to knowing when, how & why programming should be used to avoid precious time being wasted, especially in projects with short deadlines.

•	When: If something can be expressed richly without any programming, maybe the focus needs to lay somewhere else.
•	 How: If something is just too complex, consider if you can achieve what you set out to do or if it will be something that will take too much time off the other activities.
•	Why: Is this something that I want to achieve by programming, or does it communicate itself?

While programming and the use of electronic components might be key when bringing a prototype to life, it is important to plan out what I want to achieve with it, and not to waste time doing something too apprehensive and unfamiliar. But by step by step increasing your knowledge in the field, I believe it something that will be used thoroughly when prototyping. 

To summarise, learning programming has been climbing a steep hill, but a long the way picking up different building blocks and knowing what I can do with them has increased my knowledge, and provided me with confidence to take on bigger challenges.
